You are a Prolog expert. Given this availability data in JSON format: {tool_result}, and the user query: "{user_query}", generate a complete Prolog program to reason over scheduling availability. Include:
Facts for available slots (e.g., available_slot(Date, Day, Time, StartMin, EndMin)). Helper predicates (e.g., time_to_minutes/2). Rules for validation (e.g., valid_slot/5, checking if requested time is within range). Queries for exact matches or closest alternatives. Comments explaining each section to aid explainability. Ensure the code is efficient, handles edge cases like invalid dates, and outputs in JSON format for easy parsing.
